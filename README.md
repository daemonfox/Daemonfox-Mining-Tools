# Daemonfox-Mining-Tools
CMDlet for POS64 KMD based coins.

Copy this file to the folder where the daemon files reside. Typically for AGAMA, this is in the main folder you launch the shortcut, but in this directory:
\resources\app\assets\bin\win64

If running the CLI daemon, this goes in the same folder you launched the daemon from.

Suggestions are welcome. I can be found on Discord daemonfox#6136 and in the KMDLABS channel. https://discord.gg/HHzJbMC

KMD love is appreciated! RFeZSx2h7yEaXaq5PWLEHgAQYTp9PqK4CF
