ALL FILES ARE IN PLAIN TEXT AND CAN BE COPY PASTED INSTEAD OF DOWNLOADED. COMPLETE TRANSPARAENCY, USES 100% WINDOWS CMD AND KOMODO BINARIES.

Copy these file to the main wallet folder. Typically for Verus Desktop, this is in the C:\Program Files\Verus-Desktop folder.

An easy way to get to this is to use the Debug menu in Verus Desktop and click the last option, Show binary folder, then browse up to find the komodod directory.

If running the CLI daemon, these go in the same folder you launch the Komodo daemon from.

Suggestions are welcome. I can be found on Discord daemonfox#6136 and in the KMDLABS channel. https://discord.gg/HHzJbMC
